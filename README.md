support_page:
This simple page was created to help the support team perform their job in their daily routine.
Please note that some references were changed so that the software security is not compromised.

µLyrics:
An independent project I am developing. µLyrics allows users to search any song lyric and synchronize it with services like Spotify, Youtube and more!
Address: www.ulyrics.net
IMPORTANT: It is still under development, the website contains only a PROTOTYPE version of the app.
