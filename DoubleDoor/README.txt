To whom it may concern,

Thank you for selecting me for this test and compete for the position.

On /vue_website folder you will find the Vue.js website that accesses the NodeJS API on localhost.
On /basic_website folder there is a vanilla JS website I created earlier.
All NodeJS files are on root, /modules, and /routes folders.

I had to learn Vue.js to do this test and I had a fun time doing so! (there is a lot to learn yet) =)
The vue website is not mobile friendly tough =(

I will be happy to answer any questions.


Kind Regards,
Sergio C.S.
